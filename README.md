# Concurrency Test

Pet project to play around with JUnit5 extensions.

This project consists of a JUnit5 extension called `ConcurrencyTest` that can be used by adding 
the `@ConcurrencyTest` to your tests and registering the extension with the desired arguments. 

Look at the `AtomicIntegerTest` class inside the samples module for more info.
